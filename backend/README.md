## Scraping

- [ ] At the end of each week, add the "upcoming.csv" to "previous_matches.csv"
    - [ ] Somehow also get the result of the matches in "upcoming.csv" and add it as a column to the "upcoming.csv"
    - [ ] Also scrape the upcoming matches for the next week and add it to "upcoming.csv"

- [x] Add images to the fighters
    - [x] Create a new file "fighters.csv", that will contain the fighter's name & image link
    - [x] Scrape the images from the fighters' ufc pages    
    - [x] Add the image links to the "fighters.csv" file from "upcoming.csv"
    - [x] Add the image links to the "previous_matches.csv" file from "previous_matches.csv"
    - [x] Add the image links to the "previous_matches.csv" file
    - [x] Add the image links to the "upcoming.csv" file

- [ ] Make sure that scraping works in all cases

- [ ] Add all images from "previous_matches.csv" to the "fighters.csv" folder

## Model

- [ ] Make my own logistic regression model
- [ ] Maybe more features
- [ ] Reach 70% accuracy
- [ ] What to do when there's no age or reach?

## Backend

- [x] When getting the fighter data, also get the fighter's image
